This is SASICA, a plugin to EEGlab to help you reject/select independent components based on various properties of these components.

Available methods are:
             Autocorrelation: detects noisy components with weak
                              autocorrelation (muscle artifacts usually)
             Focal components: detects components that are too focal and
                              thus unlikely to correspond to neural
                              activity (bad channel or muscle usually).
             Focal trial activity: detects components with focal trial
                              activity, with same algorhithm as focal
                              components above. Results similar to trial
                              variability.
             Signal to noise ratio: detects components with weak signal
                              to noise ratio between arbitrary baseline
                              and interest time windows.
             Dipole fit residual variance: detects components with high
                              residual variance after subtraction of the
                              forward dipole model. Note that the inverse
                              dipole modeling using DIPFIT2 in EEGLAB
                              must have been computed to use this
                              measure.
             EOG correlation: detects components whose time course
                              correlates with EOG channels.
             Bad channel correlation: detects components whose time course
                              correlates with any channel(s).
             ADJUST selection: use ADJUST routines to select components
                              (see Mognon, A., Jovicich, J., Bruzzone,
                              L., & Buiatti, M. (2011). ADJUST: An
                              automatic EEG artifact detector based on
                              the joint use of spatial and temporal

             FASTER selection: use FASTER routines to select components
                              (see Nolan, H., Whelan, R., & Reilly, R. B.
                              (2010). FASTER: Fully Automated Statistical

              MARA selection: use MARA classification engine to select components
                              (see Winkler I, Haufe S, Tangermann M.
                              2011. Automatic Classification of
